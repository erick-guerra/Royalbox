Copy the config.txt and replace with existing

pi@raspberrypi: sudo cp config.txt /boot/config.txt

Now

pi@raspberrypi: sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt


quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles logo.nologo 

Here are brief explanations.
‘splash’ : enables splash image
‘quiet’ : disable boot message texts
‘plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles’ : not sure about this but seems it’s required when use Plymouth.
‘logo.nologo’ : removes Raspberry Pi logo in top left corner.

Note : Some might be there by default, but make sure if those exist.
